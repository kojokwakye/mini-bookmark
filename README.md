**[THIS](https://kojokwakye.github.io/luke23-34/)** only exists because i didn't like the way my notes app handles links. and also a lot of tabs and bookmarks in your browser makes it ugly  

i don't own **[this](https://proxybay.github.io/)**. it is bascially a poxy site for _pirate bay_ that allows you to pybass blocks.
